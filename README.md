These projects were all for the LPC1769 microcontroller. They cover a variety of use cases, subsystem implementations, and general design practices. These include GPIO usage, wave generation with Timer and Phase-Lock-Loop subsystems, and I2C communication using integrated I2C subsystems among others. 
Hardware that accompanied these projects were I/O expanders, 7-segment display, 20x4 character displays, IC amplifiers, speakers, 4-bit synchronous and asynchronous counters, an IC PLL block, a 3MHz oscillator crystal, and other basic components like switches, LEDs, capacitors, and resistors. 
Each project has an overview that describes the general purpose of the project and the specifc hardware that was used.
